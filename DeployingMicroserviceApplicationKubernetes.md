# Deploying a Microservice Application to Kubernetes

## Introduction

Microservice applications can be quite complex but that complexity can offer many benefits. Kubernetes can help you take advantage of those benefits by making these complex infrastructures easier to manage through automation. In this hands-on lab, you will see the value of Kubernetes firsthand as you deploy a complex microservice architecture to the cluster and then independently scale some of its components.

## Solution

1. Begin by logging in to the lab server using the credentials provided on the hands-on lab page:

```
ssh cloud_user@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
```


### Deploy the Stan's Robot Shop app to the cluster

1. Clone the Git repo that contains the pre-made descriptors:

```
cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/robot-shop.git
```
2. Since this application has many components, it is a good idea to create a separate namespace for the app:

```
kubectl create namespace robot-shop
```
3. Deploy the app to the cluster:

```
kubectl -n robot-shop create -f ~/robot-shop/K8s/descriptors/
```
4. Check the status of the application's pods:

```
kubectl get pods -n robot-shop
```
5. You should be able to reach the robot shop app from your browser using the Kube master node's public IP:
`http://$kube_master_public_ip:30080`


### Scale up the MongoDB deployment to two replicas instead of just one

1. Edit the deployment descriptor:

```
kubectl edit deployment mongodb -n robot-shop
```
2. You should see some YAML describing the deployment object.

    - Under `spec:`, look for the line that says `replicas: 1` and change it to `replicas: 2`.
    - Save and exit.
3. Check the status of the deployment with:

```
kubectl get deployment mongodb -n robot-shop
```
    After a few moments, the number of available replicas should be 2.


## Conclusion

Congratulations â€” you've completed this hands-on lab!
